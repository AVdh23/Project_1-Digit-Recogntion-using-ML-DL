Python-powered magic: Handwritten Number Recognition and Generation with Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
use these files  HANDWRITTENDIGITRECOGNITION_DEEPLEARNINGCNN.ipynb,HANDWRITTENDIGITRECOGNITION_MACHINE LEARNING.ipynb and also run this code Handwritten_Digit_Recognition .ipynb , before running these two files.

Model folder contains all the model used to train the models.
Input_images is the folder of my dataset.
